# 📘 EduSearch AI — Intelligent Retrieval System for Higher Education Data

## 🧩 Problem Description

The **Department of Higher Education** under the **Ministry of Education (MoE)** manages numerous **functional rules, regulations, policies, schemes, and projects**.  
While performing daily operations and coordinating with institutions, officials often need to **refer, compare, and analyze** large volumes of information from multiple sources.

Currently, this process is:
- **Manual** and time-consuming  
- **Dependent on individual expertise**  
- Lacking centralized access to authentic data  
- Slowing down **decision-making and coordination**

## 🎯 Expected Solution

Develop an **AI-powered tool** that enables:
- **Smart search and retrieval** of data from large databases based on **keywords or user queries**
- **Semantic understanding** of context to provide **relevant and accurate results**
- **Automated analysis and summarization** of retrieved content
- **Streamlined access** to information across departments, policies, and schemes

This system will help authorities and decision-makers **quickly locate, interpret, and act upon** authentic educational data.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

| Category | Technologies |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Frontend** | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| **Backend** | Python (Flask / FastAPI) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL / MongoDB |
| **AI/ML Components** | LangChain, FAISS / ChromaDB, OpenAI API / LLaMA |
| **Hosting & Deployment** | Streamlit / Render / AWS / Hugging Face Spaces |

## 🧠 Key Features

✅ **Intelligent Keyword Search:** Retrieves the most relevant regulations, policies, and project details.  
✅ **Natural Language Querying:** Officials can use simple language to search instead of complex filters.  
✅ **Document Embedding:** Converts text into embeddings for semantic retrieval.  
✅ **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Combines retrieved data with LLM reasoning for precise answers.  
✅ **Data Visualization (optional):** Displays summaries, charts, and document links.  
✅ **Access Control:** Role-based secure access for authorized officials.
